<h1>About the Password Generator</h1>
<h3>Programmed by: John Kile</h3>
<p>The password generator is a program/app that will take users input of the length desired and if the users wants any combination of capital letters, special characters and/or numbers added in the generation of the lowercase letter password. It is all random so there is no pattern to where any of the characters are placed throughout the new password.</p>
